[Update July 2018] The authors have released their official implementation of LOLA [here](https://github.com/alshedivat/lola)

This is an implementation of the Learning with Opponent Learning Awareness [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04326) by Foerster et al. 

It is a work in progress. Have only done the exact updates on Prisoners' Dilemma till now, to get the basics working.
